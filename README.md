# data_wrangling-twitter

In this project, I gathered, assessed and cleaned Twitter data from the WeRateDogs account to see what interesting insights could be drawn. The result provides a general look into what the most popular dog breed is according to WeRateDogs' 5 million followers.

## Getting Started

This project is informational and does not require you to run any code. This project is meant to display the analysis I conducted on the data I gathered.
